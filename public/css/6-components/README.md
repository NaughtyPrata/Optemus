## Notes

- **Gallery CSS Consolidation**: Previously, gallery styling was spread across multiple files (`gallery-fix.css`, `gallery-grid-fix.css`, and `gallery-overlap-fix.css`). These have been consolidated into a single `gallery.css` file to fix image overlapping issues and improve maintainability.
