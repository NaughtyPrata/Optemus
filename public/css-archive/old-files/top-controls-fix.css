/* Top Controls Positioning Fix 
   This CSS resolves an alignment issue where the buttons in image-top-controls
   were aligning to the left instead of the right.
   
   The fix targets a width constraint in neumorphism.css that was causing the issue.
   We use CSS specificity to override the styles without !important tags.
*/

/* Override the width constraint in neumorphism.css */
body .image-top-controls,
.app-container .image-top-controls {
  width: auto;
  /* Ensure other critical properties are reinforced */
  display: flex;
  justify-content: flex-end;
}

/* Add spacing between buttons */
body .image-top-controls .sound-toggle-btn,
.app-container .image-top-controls .sound-toggle-btn {
  margin-right: 10px;
}
